<h1>Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide</h1>

<h2>About</h2>

<p>This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
level of instruction... <i>all the while sneaking in little
nuggets of UNIXÂ® wisdom and lore.</i> It serves as a textbook, a manual
for self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell
scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
invite active reader participation, under the premise that
<i>the only way to really learn scripting is to write
scripts.</i></p>

<h2>Forked</h2>

<p>The Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide is a book written by <b>Mendel
Cooper</b> and part of The Linux Documentation Project, page <a
href='https://www.tldp.org/guides.html'>Guides</a>. This is a fork of
the original work which itself had been (since 2014) dedicated to the
<b>Public Domain</b>.</p>
