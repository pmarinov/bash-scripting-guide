What is new in the Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide


## 2024-08-13, v0.2.1, Markdown rendering in AWK

Anybody deeply interested in shell scripting will at some point come
across `awk`. In the spirit of *do one thing and do it well*, `awk`
can be defined as a **line-oriented** processor **with state**. In
contrast, `sed` is a line-oriented with rules that provide only a
stateless form.

Rendering of Markdown format combines line-oriented approach with the
need for a state. As a form of an introduction to `awk`, a
**rendering** of Markdown is provided as a somewhat useful example.
