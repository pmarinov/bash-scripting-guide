*Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide*
(New Edition based on Pollen)

== About ==

The _Advanced Bash-Scripting Guide_ is a book written by Mendel Cooper
and part of The Linux Documentation Project, page
{guides}[Guides]. *This is a fork* of the original work which itself
had been (since 2014) dedicated to the *Public Domain*.

Motivation for the new edition:

* To produce a modern-looking HTML format
* To produce a GNU Info format, readable inside Emacs
* To use Pollen as a publishing system, see {pollen}["Pollen: the book
  is a program"]
* To invite contributions by hosting on GitHub

Public Domain, see {license}[LICENSE.txt]

== Changelog ==

2019-11-17, v0.2.0, pmarinov

* First 2 chapters formatted for GNU Info reader and in HTML
