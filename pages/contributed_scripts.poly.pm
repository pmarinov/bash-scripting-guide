# ##################################################################### #
# This is the Bash script version of John Conway's "Game of Life".      #
# "Life" is a simple implementation of cellular automata.               #
# --------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# On a rectangular grid, let each "cell" be either "living" or "dead."  #
# Designate a living cell with a dot, and a dead one with a blank space.#
#      Begin with an arbitrarily drawn dot-and-blank grid,              #
#+     and let this be the starting generation: generation 0.           #
# Determine each successive generation by the following rules:          #
#   1) Each cell has 8 neighbors, the adjoining cells                   #
#+     left, right, top, bottom, and the 4 diagonals.                   #
#                                                                       #

#                       4*5     The * is the cell under consideration.  #
#                       678                                             #

# 2) A living cell with either 2 or 3 living neighbors remains alive.   #
SURVIVE=2                                                               #
# 3) A dead cell with 3 living neighbors comes alive, a "birth."        #
