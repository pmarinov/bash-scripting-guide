These scripts, while not fitting into the text of this document, do
illustrate some interesting shell programming techniques. Some are
useful, too. Have fun analyzing and running them.

◊anchored-example[#:anchor "mail_fmt1"]{mailformat: Formatting an
e-mail message}

◊example{
#!/bin/bash
# mail-format.sh (ver. 1.1): Format e-mail messages.

# Gets rid of carets, tabs, and also folds excessively long lines.

# =================================================================
#                 Standard Check for Script Argument(s)
ARGS=1
E_BADARGS=85
E_NOFILE=86

if [ $# -ne $ARGS ]  # Correct number of arguments passed to script?
then
  echo "Usage: `basename $0` filename"
  exit $E_BADARGS
fi

if [ -f "$1" ]       # Check if file exists.
then
    file_name=$1
else
    echo "File \"$1\" does not exist."
    exit $E_NOFILE
fi
# -----------------------------------------------------------------

MAXWIDTH=70          # Width to fold excessively long lines to.

# =================================
# A variable can hold a sed script.
# It's a useful technique.
sedscript='s/^>//
s/^  *>//
s/^  *//
s/		*//'
# =================================

#  Delete carets and tabs at beginning of lines,
#+ then fold lines to $MAXWIDTH characters.
sed "$sedscript" $1 | fold -s --width=$MAXWIDTH
                        #  -s option to "fold"
                        #+ breaks lines at whitespace, if possible.


#  This script was inspired by an article in a well-known trade journal
#+ extolling a 164K MS Windows utility with similar functionality.
#
#  An nice set of text processing utilities and an efficient
#+ scripting language provide an alternative to the bloated executables
#+ of a clunky operating system.
