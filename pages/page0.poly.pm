This tutorial assumes no previous knowledge of scripting or
programming, yet progresses rapidly toward an intermediate/advanced
level of instruction . . . all the while sneaking in little nuggets of
UNIX® wisdom and lore. It serves as a textbook, a manual for
self-study, and as a reference and source of knowledge on shell
scripting techniques. The exercises and heavily-commented examples
invite active reader participation, under the premise that the only
way to really learn scripting is to write scripts.

This book is suitable for classroom use as a general introduction to
programming concepts.
