◊section{Note}

How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It
seems that a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and
what better way to do that than to read a good book on the subject? I
was looking to buy a tutorial and reference covering all aspects of
the subject. I was looking for a book that would take difficult
concepts, turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating
detail, with well-commented examples. [1] In fact, I was looking for
this very book, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, it
didn't exist, and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so, here
we are, folks.

That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy
as a loon, the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the
library, at a bookstore, anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed
with the idea that he could have written it, should have written it --
and done a better job of it to boot. He would thereupon rush home and
proceed to do just that, write a book with the very same title. When
he died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books to
his credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not
have been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a
fellow who lived his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by
it . . . and somehow I can't help admiring the old coot.

◊section{Hardware used}

A used IBM Thinkpad, model 760XL laptop (P166, 104 meg RAM) running
Red Hat 7.1/7.3. Sure, it's slow and has a funky keyboard, but it
beats the heck out of a No. 2 pencil and a Big Chief tablet.

Update: upgraded to a 770Z Thinkpad (P2-366, 192 meg RAM) running
FC3. Anyone feel like donating a later-model laptop to a starving
writer?

Update: upgraded to a T61 Thinkpad running Mandriva 2011. No longer
starving, but not too proud to accept donations.
