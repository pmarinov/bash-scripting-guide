◊list-entry{Edited by Peter Denning, "Computers Under Attack:
Intruders, Worms, and Viruses", ACM Press, 1990, 0-201-53067-8.

This compendium contains a couple of articles on shell script viruses.

◊list-entry{Ken Burtch, "Linux Shell Scripting with Bash", 1st
edition, Sams Publishing (Pearson), 2004, 0672326426.

Covers much of the same material as the ABS Guide, though in a
different style.

◊list-entry{Daniel Goldman, "Definitive Guide to Sed", 1st edition,
2013.

This ebook is an excellent introduction to sed. Rather than being a
conversion from a printed volume, it was specifically designed and
formatted for viewing on an ebook reader. Well-written, informative,
and useful as a reference as well as a tutorial. Highly recommended.

}

◊list-entry{Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins, "Sed and Awk, 2nd
edition", O'Reilly and Associates, 1997, 1-156592-225-5.

Unfolding the full power of shell scripting requires at least a
passing familiarity with sed and awk. This is the classic tutorial. It
includes an excellent introduction to Regular
Expressions. Recommended.

}

◊list-entry{Jeffrey Friedl, "Mastering Regular Expressions", O'Reilly
and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00289-0.

Still the best all-around reference on Regular Expressions.

}

◊list-entry{Aeleen Frisch, "Essential System Administration", 3rd
edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00343-9.

This excellent manual provides a decent introduction to shell
scripting from a sys admin point of view. It includes comprehensive
explanations of the startup and initialization scripts in a UNIX
system.

}

◊list-entry{Stephen Kochan and Patrick Wood, "Unix Shell Programming",
Hayden, 1990, 067248448X.

Still considered a standard reference, though somewhat dated, and a
bit "wooden" stylistically speaking. ◊footnote{It was hard to resist
the obvious pun. No slight intended, since the book is a pretty decent
introduction to the basic concepts of shell scripting.} In fact, this
book was the ABS Guide author's first exposure to UNIX shell
scripting, lo these many years ago.

}

◊list-entry{Neil Matthew and Richard Stones, "Beginning Linux
Programming", Wrox Press, 1996, 1874416680.

Surprisingly good in-depth coverage of various programming languages
available for Linux, including a fairly strong chapter on shell
scripting.

}

◊list-entry{Herbert Mayer, "Advanced C Programming on the IBM PC",
Windcrest Books, 1989, 0830693637.

Excellent coverage of algorithms and general programming
practices. Highly recommended, but unfortunately out of print.

}

◊list-entry{David Medinets, "Unix Shell Programming Tools",
McGraw-Hill, 1999, 0070397333.

Pretty good treatment of shell scripting, with examples, and a short
intro to Tcl and Perl.
