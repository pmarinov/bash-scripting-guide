◊list-entry{Edited by Peter Denning, "Computers Under Attack:
Intruders, Worms, and Viruses", ACM Press, 1990, 0-201-53067-8.

This compendium contains a couple of articles on shell script viruses.

}

◊list-entry{Ken Burtch, "Linux Shell Scripting with Bash", 1st
edition, Sams Publishing (Pearson), 2004, 0672326426.

Covers much of the same material as the ABS Guide, though in a
different style.

}

◊list-entry{Daniel Goldman, "Definitive Guide to Sed", 1st edition,
2013.

This ebook is an excellent introduction to sed. Rather than being a
conversion from a printed volume, it was specifically designed and
formatted for viewing on an ebook reader. Well-written, informative,
and useful as a reference as well as a tutorial. Highly recommended.

}

◊list-entry{Dale Dougherty and Arnold Robbins, "Sed and Awk, 2nd
edition", O'Reilly and Associates, 1997, 1-156592-225-5.

Unfolding the full power of shell scripting requires at least a
passing familiarity with sed and awk. This is the classic tutorial. It
includes an excellent introduction to Regular
Expressions. Recommended.

}

◊list-entry{Jeffrey Friedl, "Mastering Regular Expressions", O'Reilly
and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00289-0.

Still the best all-around reference on Regular Expressions.

}

◊list-entry{Aeleen Frisch, "Essential System Administration", 3rd
edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 2002, 0-596-00343-9.

This excellent manual provides a decent introduction to shell
scripting from a sys admin point of view. It includes comprehensive
explanations of the startup and initialization scripts in a UNIX
system.

}

◊list-entry{Stephen Kochan and Patrick Wood, "Unix Shell Programming",
Hayden, 1990, 067248448X.

Still considered a standard reference, though somewhat dated, and a
bit "wooden" stylistically speaking. ◊footnote{It was hard to resist
the obvious pun. No slight intended, since the book is a pretty decent
introduction to the basic concepts of shell scripting.} In fact, this
book was the ABS Guide author's first exposure to UNIX shell
scripting, lo these many years ago.

}

◊list-entry{Neil Matthew and Richard Stones, "Beginning Linux
Programming", Wrox Press, 1996, 1874416680.

Surprisingly good in-depth coverage of various programming languages
available for Linux, including a fairly strong chapter on shell
scripting.

}

◊list-entry{Herbert Mayer, "Advanced C Programming on the IBM PC",
Windcrest Books, 1989, 0830693637.

Excellent coverage of algorithms and general programming
practices. Highly recommended, but unfortunately out of print.

}

◊list-entry{David Medinets, "Unix Shell Programming Tools",
McGraw-Hill, 1999, 0070397333.

Pretty good treatment of shell scripting, with examples, and a short
intro to Tcl and Perl.

}

◊list-entry{Cameron Newham and Bill Rosenblatt, "Learning the Bash
Shell", 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1998, 1-56592-347-2.

This is a valiant effort at a decent shell primer, but sadly deficient
in its coverage of writing scripts and lacking sufficient examples.

}

◊list-entry{Anatole Olczak, "Bourne Shell Quick Reference Guide", ASP,
Inc., 1991, 093573922X.

A very handy pocket reference, despite lacking coverage of
Bash-specific features.

}

◊list-entry{Jerry Peek, Tim O'Reilly, and Mike Loukides, "Unix Power
Tools", 3rd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, Random House, 2002,
0-596-00330-7.

Contains a couple of sections of very informative in-depth articles on
shell programming, but falls short of being a self-teaching manual. It
reproduces much of the Regular Expressions tutorial from the Dougherty
and Robbins book, above. The comprehensive coverage of UNIX commands
makes this book worthy of a place on your bookshelf.

}

◊list-entry{Clifford Pickover, Computers, Pattern, Chaos, and Beauty,
St. Martin's Press, 1990, 0-312-04123-3.

A treasure trove of ideas and recipes for computer-based exploration
of mathematical oddities.

}

◊list-entry{George Polya, "How To Solve It", Princeton University Press,
1973, 0-691-02356-5.

The classic tutorial on problem-solving methods (algorithms), with
special emphasis on how to teach them.

}

◊list-entry{Chet Ramey and Brian Fox, "The GNU Bash Reference Manual",
Network Theory Ltd, 2003, 0-9541617-7-7.

This manual is the definitive reference for GNU Bash. The authors of
this manual, Chet Ramey and Brian Fox, are the original developers of
GNU Bash. For each copy sold, the publisher donates $1 to the Free
Software Foundation.

}

◊list-entry{Arnold Robbins, "Bash Reference Card", SSC, 1998,
1-58731-010-5.

Excellent Bash pocket reference (don't leave home without it,
especially if you're a sysadmin). A bargain at $4.95, but
unfortunately no longer available for free download.

}

◊list-entry{Arnold Robbins, "Effective Awk Programming", Free Software
Foundation / O'Reilly and Associates, 2000, 1-882114-26-4.

The absolute best awk tutorial and reference. The free electronic
version of this book is part of the awk documentation, and printed
copies of the latest version are available from O'Reilly and
Associates.

This book served as an inspiration for the author of the ABS Guide.

}

◊list-entry{Bill Rosenblatt, "Learning the Korn Shell", O'Reilly and
Associates, 1993, 1-56592-054-6.

This well-written book contains some excellent pointers on shell
scripting in general.

}

◊list-entry{Paul Sheer, LINUX: Rute User's Tutorial and Exposition,
1st edition, , 2002, 0-13-033351-4.

Very detailed and readable introduction to Linux system
administration.

The book is available in print, or on-line.

}

◊list-entry{Ellen Siever and the staff of O'Reilly and Associates,
Linux in a Nutshell, 2nd edition, O'Reilly and Associates, 1999,
1-56592-585-8.

The all-around best Linux command reference. It even has a Bash
section.

}

◊list-entry{Dave Taylor, "Wicked Cool Shell Scripts: 101 Scripts for
Linux, Mac OS X, and Unix Systems", 1st edition, No Starch Press,
2004, 1-59327-012-7.

Pretty much what the title promises . . .

}

◊list-entry{"The UNIX CD Bookshelf", 3rd edition, O'Reilly and
Associates, 2003, 0-596-00392-7.

An array of seven UNIX books on CD ROM, including UNIX Power Tools,
Sed and Awk, and Learning the Korn Shell. A complete set of all the
UNIX references and tutorials you would ever need at about $130. Buy
this one, even if it means going into debt and not paying the rent.

Update: Seems to have somehow fallen out of print. Ah, well. You can
still buy the dead-tree editions of these books.

books.)
