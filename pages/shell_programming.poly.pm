No programming language is perfect. There is not even a single best
language; there are only languages well suited or perhaps poorly
suited for particular purposes.

--Herbert Mayer

A working knowledge of shell scripting is essential to anyone wishing
to become reasonably proficient at system administration, even if they
do not anticipate ever having to actually write a script. Consider
that as a Linux machine boots up, it executes the shell scripts in
/etc/rc.d to restore the system configuration and set up services. A
detailed understanding of these startup scripts is important for
analyzing the behavior of a system, and possibly modifying it.
